This Project is an early experimental version of **Tatsam** and consists of the Status & Next Checkpoint of the project.

## Names of confusion:-
 1. CommonInputFeedback -> Entity for persisting text/voicenotes which are not in perform-activity flow.
 2. ActivityRating -> Entity which helps in giving rating after any activity is completed.
 3. ActivityFeedback -> Entity for persisting text/voicenotes which are in the perform-activity flow and would be shown in My Diary section of profile.


## Next Checkpoint

 1. Completing the questionnaire feature
 2. Completing usecases of path domain
 3. Rapport Building Screen-3 Usecase finalization.
 4. An overall walkthrough of Hub.
 5. Write GitHub-Actions config file for quick glanced test results
 6. There should be changeLocal() server side too per user??
 7. We can make a responsiveScaledWrapper() widget which will make achieving       responsivesness easier in near future
